## 📖 Description

**WP Notice Manager** solves the problem of admin notice clutter in WordPress dashboards.

### The Problem
WordPress dashboards are often flooded with admin notices from:
- WordPress core updates
- Plugin notifications
- Theme alerts
- System warnings

This causes:
- Important notices being ignored
- Dashboard clutter
- Poor admin experience
- Missed critical updates

### The Solution
WP Notice Manager captures all admin notices and displays them in a clean, centralized popup interface accessible from the WordPress admin toolbar.
